# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions Dashboard (1750 – 2022)

### 📊 About the Project
An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing 250 years of global CO₂ emissions data to uncover patterns, trends, and regional disparities.  
Built as part of Maven Environmental’s mission to promote data-driven climate awareness.

### 🎯 Objectives
1. Profile and clean the raw dataset for accuracy.
2. Visualize emission trends, geographic distribution, and population relationships.
3. Build an interactive dashboard with filters and parameters for public use.

### 🧩 Dataset
- **Source:** Global CO₂ Emissions (1750 – 2021)
- **Format:** Single CSV (50K+ records, 79 fields)
- **Metrics:** CO₂ Totals, CO₂ Per Capita, Population, Temperature Change from CO₂.

### ⚙️ Tools & Tech
- **Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public**
- **Excel / CSV**
- **Data Cleaning:** Filters, field type updates, parameters.

### 📈 Dashboard Features
- **Line Chart:** % of Global CO₂ Share by Year (Top N countries)
- **Map:** CO₂ Per Capita by Country (2021)
- **Scatter Plot:** CO₂ vs Population (bubble size = Temperature Change)
- **Interactive Controls:** Top N parameter, Country filter.

### 💡 Key Insights
- Africa & South America = Low CO₂ per capita.  
- U.S. & China lead global emissions, but China’s growth is population-proportional.  
- U.S. remains an over-emitter relative to population.  

### 🧠 Learnings
- Effective use of parameters and filters for dynamic visual analysis.
- Importance of consistent data types for accurate Tableau aggregations.
- Balancing storytelling with interactivity for public dashboards.
